# Price Transparency Machine-readable File Validator

This tool is used to validate machine-readable files in JSON format against the [schemas published by CMS](https://github.com/CMSgov/price-transparency-guide).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node (version 16.x)
- NPM (version 8.5.x)
- Git (latest version recommended, tested using 2.27.0)
- Docker (version 19.x)

### Instructions

Clone this repository using Git in the desired installation location:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CMSgov/price-transparency-guide-validator.git
```

Make sure that Docker is running:

```bash
docker ps
```

If this shows a table of active containers and their resource usage, then Docker is active.

From the directory containing the clone, build the validator Docker image:

```bash
cd price-transparency-guide-validator
docker build -t validator .
```

Install the Node script with the `-g` global flag so it can be run from any location:

```
npm install -g cms-mrf-validator
```

## Usage

The validator can be run from any directory. For basic usage instructions:

```
cms-mrf-validator help
```

```

Options:
  -h, --help                                       display help for command

Commands:
  validate [options] <data-file> <schema-version>  Validate a file against a specific published version of a CMS schema.
  update                                           Update the available schemas from the CMS repository.
  help [command]                                   display help for command
```

### Update available schemas

In order to perform validation, schemas must be available to the validator tool. The latest schemas can be obtained using the update command.

From the installed directory:

```
cms-mrf-validator update
```

### Validate a file

Validating a file against one of the provided schemas is the primary usage of this tool. Be sure that you have the latest schemas available by [running the update command](#update-available-schemas) first.

From the installed directory:

```
cms-mrf-validator validate <data-file> <schema-version> [-o out] [-t target]
```

Example usages:

```bash
# basic usage, printing output directly and using the default in-network-rates schema
cms-mrf-validator validate my-data.json v1.0.0
# output will be written to a file. validate using allowed-amounts schema
cms-mrf-validator validate my-data.json v1.0.0 -o results.txt -t allowed-amounts
```

Further details:

```
Validate a file against a specific published version of a CMS schema.

Arguments:
  data-file              path to data file to validate
  schema-version         version of schema to use for validation

Options:
  -o, --out <out>        output path
  -t, --target <schema>  name of schema to use (choices: "allowed-amounts", "in-network-rates", "provider-reference",
                         "table-of-contents", default: "in-network-rates")
  -h, --help             display help for command
```

### Test file validation

This project contains sample JSON files that can be used to familiarize yourself with the validation tool. These examples can be found in the [`test-files`](https://github.com/CMSgov/price-transparency-guide-validator/tree/documentation/test-files) directory.

Running the command from the root of the project:

#### Running a valid file:

```bash
cms-mrf-validator validate test-files/in-network-rates-fee-for-service-sample.json v1.0.0
```

Output:

```
Input JSON is valid.
```

#### Running an invalid file:

```bash
cms-mrf-validator validate test-files/allowed-amounts-error.json v1.0.0 -t allowed-amounts
```

Output:

```bash
Input JSON is invalid.

    }
}
```

### Performance Considerations

This validation tool is based on [rapidjson](https://rapidjson.org/) which is a high performance C++ JSON parser. You can find various benchmarks on [rapidjson's site](https://rapidjson.org/md_doc_performance.html) that should give the user an idea on what to expect when using.

The exact amount of time needed for the validator to run will vary based on input file size and the machine running the validator. On a sample system with a 2.60GHz CPU and 16GB of memory, a typical processing rate is approximately 25 megabytes of input per second.
